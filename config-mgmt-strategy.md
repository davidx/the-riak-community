# Config Mgmt Strategy

At this time, configuration management (CM) code is a community "best effort" initiative. Maintaining these repositories that are useful for Riak configuration will require a combination of clear guidelines and community collaboration. 

Here's where we think we're starting and some direction on where we go. We'd love for you to be part of the process.


### What we mean by Configuration Management

Configuration management tools install packages, manage configuration files, control services, and otherwise define infrastructure state using code.
These tools simplify installation and management of Riak. The basho-labs project includes code for managing Riak using [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) and [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/). We (at Basho) see the automation and orchestration available through these products as core to infrastructure today.


### Our Goal [Very Beta - Open PRs to Discuss]

We're starting by focusing on just Riak, our distributed database.

We'd like to have a single system for all tools that tells you, the community member, how much Riak functionality is available by using it. Each toolset has its own terms and best practices. That's fine. What we would like to achieve is a common ground for definitions of Riak's functions in relation to these tools.

We'll call each code base's compliance a **Riak management level** (RML). RMLs will have different levels that are clearly defined below as either **Basic**, **Intermediate** or **Advanced**. RMLs will be defined for each tool and each functional requirement.

### Community Supported Repos
Here are the three repositories monitored by @mjbrender from the Developer Advocacy team. You can add other helpful repos that should be kept in consideration here.

* **Chef** = https://github.com/basho-labs/riak-chef-cookbook
* **Ansible** = https://github.com/basho-labs/ansible-riak
* **Puppet** = https://github.com/basho-labs/puppet-riak
